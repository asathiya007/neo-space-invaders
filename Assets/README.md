The contents of the `Prefabs` directory were developed by following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWDQgmdUzWI&ab_channel=Zigurous.

The contents of the `Scenes` and `Scripts` directories were initially developed by following the tutorial and were built upon afterward to support additional scenes, more sophisticated adaptive difficulty, and AI-generated backgrounds and sprites (obtained via API calls).

The contents of the `Sprites` directory were obtained from this source (GitHub repo created by the tutorial author): https://github.com/zigurous/unity-space-invaders-tutorial/tree/main/Assets/Sprites

The contents of the `ScreenImages` directory were created in Google Slides.
