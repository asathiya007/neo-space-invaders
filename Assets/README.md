The contents of the `Prefabs`, `Scenes`, and `Scripts` directories were developed by following this tutorial: https://youtu.be/qWDQgmdUzWI?si=5uC_KWWAd8g7vYDO, and modified to support AI-generated backgrounds and sprites, obtained via API calls. 

The contents of the `Sprites` directory were obtained from this source (GitHub repo created by the tutorial author): https://github.com/zigurous/unity-space-invaders-tutorial/tree/main/Assets/Sprites
